Intermediate Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of intermediate-level Python projects implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. 
Each project focuses on practical real-world applications, algorithmic thinking, and clean modular Python design. 
These projects are ideal for learners looking to strengthen their logic, improve their problem-solving skills, and build portfolio-ready applications.

📂 Projects Included
1. All-In-One Notes App
A multipurpose notes application that allows users to:
Create, edit, search, and delete notes.
Categorize notes for better organization.
Store data persistently.
Perfect for learning file handling and basic CRUD operations.

2. Automated Resume Screening System
A resume processing tool that:
Reads PDF/DOCX resumes
Extracts text content using NLP preprocessing
Compares resume content with job descriptions
Generates similarity scores
Useful for learning text extraction, stopword filtering, vectorization, and cosine similarity.

3. Movie Recommendation System
A content-based recommendation engine that:
Stores a dataset of movie titles, genres, and descriptions
Suggests similar movies using text similarity
Works even when the user inputs a movie name manually
Introduces vectorization, similarity matrices, and structured data handling.

4. Rank-Based Percentile Calculator
A simple tool that:
Accepts a rank and total entries
Calculates percentile using mathematical formulas
Useful for competitive exams and performance evaluation
Focuses on mathematical functions and user-defined logic.

5. Safe Route System
A route-planning concept that:
Evaluates routes based on risk factors
Uses scoring logic to determine the safest path
Good for learning decision systems, custom scoring logic, and data structures.

6. Uno Bank – Card Game
A number-based card game where:
Each draw can increase, decrease, double, or halve the score
The goal is to maximize balance
Implemented with clean game logic and event handling
Enhances algorithmic thinking and randomness handling.

🧠 Skills Strengthened
File handling (PDF, DOCX, text)
NumPy / NLP preprocessing
Recommendation algorithms
Mathematical modeling
Game logic and simulations
Modular programming
Problem-solving and clean code structuring
