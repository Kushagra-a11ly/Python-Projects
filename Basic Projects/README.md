🐍 Python Beginner Projects

Welcome to Python Beginner Projects!
This repository contains a collection of simple and beginner-friendly Python programs designed to strengthen your understanding of fundamental programming concepts. Each project is small, interactive, and ideal for anyone looking to practice logic building and enhance their Python basics.

🚀 Project Overview:
1. ATM Simulator:
A command-line based ATM system that allows users to perform simple banking operations such as checking balance, depositing amount, and withdrawing cash. It mimics real-life ATM interactions and helps beginners understand how digital transactions work.

2. Emoji Mood Detector:
A fun and interactive program that takes a user’s mood or feeling and responds with a matching emoji. It transforms simple text input into expressive emoji output, making the interaction playful and engaging.

3. Palindrome Checker:
This tool checks whether a given word, number, or phrase reads the same backward as forward. It demonstrates basic string handling in Python and helps users understand text manipulation.

4. Password Strength Checker:
A simple checker that evaluates how strong a password is by examining its length and character combinations. It guides users toward creating safer and stronger passwords through clear feedback.

5. Rock Paper Scissors:
A classic game where the user competes against the computer in a quick match of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each round is random and unpredictable, making it a fun way to practice Python conditions and logic.

6. Simple Calculator:
A basic mathematical calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It offers a clean command-line experience for solving quick calculations.

7. Simple To-Do List:
A lightweight task manager that helps users store, view, and remove tasks. This project introduces the idea of keeping track of information during a program’s runtime in an easy and organized manner.

8. Word Counter:
A small utility that counts the number of words in a sentence or paragraph provided by the user. It is a great example of how Python can be used to analyze and work with natural text.

📌 Requirements:
Python 3.7 or higher.
No external libraries needed — everything runs on the standard Python library.
